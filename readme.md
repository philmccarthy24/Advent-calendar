# Reusable customisable A3 size Advent Calendar

## Instructions
1. 3d print all the stl files. There are 8 parts, 4 for a frame, and 4 for central "trays" with windows to hold the chocolates.
2. Put the BR, BL, TR, TL (bottom right etc) frame parts together, glue, and then glue in the trays. Use superglue maybe?
3. Generate an advent calendar window overlay using the gen\_windows\_overlay.py script. Follow instructions [here](https://pypi.org/project/drawSvg/) to install dependencies. You can put in the size of desired output image you want in the script. This will spit out a png file.
4. Use a photo editer like [gimp](https://www.gimp.org) to open a christmassy image of your choice. Resize and crop to a ratio 420 to 297. Import the overlay as a layer. Export the whole lot to png file.
5. 2d print your calendar image to A3 (I'd recommend photo paper). Use a craft knife to cut out 3 sides of each window.
6. Populate the reusable frame with chocolates (something like Celebrations if that's your poison), 
7. Slide the A3 calendar front into the frame
8. Experience the magical wonder of an advent chocolate each day, in the count down to Christmas.
